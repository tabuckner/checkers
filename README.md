# CheckersChecker

To experiment with this, `yarn install`, modify the POC implementation at `src/index.js`, and run `yarn start`.

## Thoughts

If I were to approach this assignment again, I would have focused more on setting up an intuitive UI of some sort (doesn't need to be a _G_ UI). I'm imagining a CLI tool w/ a prompt that asks you for each input.

When I went back and read the prompt before submitting I was a little disappointed that I didn't put as much focus on this, but I stand by my implementation as I think the goal was to get a feel for my coding style.

For a ~4 hour implementation broken up across a lunch-break-here, and a after-dinner-there, this is okay. There is _always room to improve_.
